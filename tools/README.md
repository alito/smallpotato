This directory contains a mishmash of scripts that are or were useful at some point during development

* procvalues.py: Transform a sort of human readable form of the position-value
tables to something smallpotato can understand with the -values switch

* makebookfrompgn.py: Feed a pgn file (with possibly thousands of games) to
smallpotato to add to its book.opn
