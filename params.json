{"name":"Smallpotato","tagline":"Chess engine. Works with Xboard/Winboard and any interface that talks that protocol","body":"Small Potato - xboard/winboard compatible chess engine\r\n======================================================\r\n\r\nA chess engine, like Crafty or gnuchess or Fruit, but much weaker. It would probable rate around 2100 on five-minute games. **It currently does not run on 64-bit OSes**\r\n\r\nWindow binaries: http://organicrobot.com/smallpotato/smallpotato061.zip  \r\nBook: http://organicrobot.com/smallpotato/book.zip or http://organicrobot.com/smallpotato/book.opn.bz2\r\nUncompress the book and put in the same directory as the binary.\r\n\r\nTo run using xboard as a frontend, use  \r\n`xboard -fcp smallpotato`  \r\nTo run it through WinBoard, you will need to add something like the following to your winboard.ini:  \r\n`/fcp smallpotato /fd \"full\\path\\to\\smallpotato\\directory\"`  \r\n`/scp smallpotato /sd \"full\\path\\to\\smallpotato\\directory\"`  \r\n\r\nChange engine settings by editing sp.rc\r\n\r\nFor the chess-engine enthusiast, it implements:\r\n* Negascout\r\n* Transposition table\r\n* Quiescent search\r\n* Null-move pruning\r\n* History move ordering\r\n* Run-time configurable value tables\r\n\r\nMore information on the README\r\n\r\n###25/09/03 - 0.6.1\r\n* Tweaked move ordering (including addition of killer move heuristic)\r\n* Minor tweaking of evaluation (with unknown consequences)\r\n* More configurable settings\r\n* Removed MTD(f) and standard alpha-beta search as search options\r\n* Bugfixes (including K v K draw claim)\r\n\r\n###17/09/02 - 0.6.0\r\n* Added null-move pruning and aspiration window.\r\n* Improved endgame evaluation (or, more precisely, it now has a separate endgame evaluation).  Same with king execution phase.\r\n* Now claims draw on insufficient material.\r\n* Slightly friendlier command line mode.\r\n* Minor bugfixes (fen/epd parsing).\r\n\r\n###18/08/02 - 0.5.1\r\n* Now can be configured through file.\r\n* It can now resign.\r\n* Switched, and very slightly tweaked, default evaluation function.\r\n* Speeded up by about 20%.\r\n\r\n###03/08/02 - 0.5.0\r\n* Switched default search algorithm to negascout\r\n* Now recover a PV line for display\r\n* Minor transposition table tweaking\r\n* Minor fixes of bugs introduced in 0.4.0\r\n* Now compiles out-of-the-box in clig-less systems.\r\n\r\n###17/07/02 - 0.4.0\r\n* Implemented move now and analyze.\r\n* Switched to 0x88 move generation.\r\n\r\n###11/04/02 - 0.3.3\r\n* Added opening book.\r\n* EPD suites and lines can be solved\r\n* Made it portable to cygwin\r\n* Changed default hashtable size to 32MB.\r\n* Can now specify hashtable size in kilobytes.\r\n* Made aleweights.out be loaded by default\r\n\r\n###03/04/02 - 0.3.2\r\n* No changes (reflex action release that shouldn't have \r\n* happened due to unkown last release)\r\n\r\n###08/03/02 - 0.3.1\r\n* Changed to delayed checking of check for speculated performance improvement (even though it does not seem to have materialised)\r\n* Got rid of a couple of often used functions with array lookups for definite performance gains.\r\n* Completed switch to move/unmove.\r\n\r\n###26/02/02 - 0.3.0\r\n* Changed name to Small Potato\r\n* Changed to move/unmove instead of move/copy struct (faster)\r\n* Implemented undo and remove for xboard/protocol 2 programs\r\n* (Note:  Search instability noted in previous version is \"meant\" to be there. Caused by the nature of transposition tables, not by some bug in implementation)\r\n* No bugfixes\r\n\r\n###07/11/01 - 0.2.4\r\n* Better randomised play\r\n* Switched to 64-bit random hashes\r\n* Lots of bugfixes, including the crash on start introduced in v0.2.3, PGN output bugfixes, and some silliness in QuiescentSearch.\r\n* (NOTE:  Search instability still there)\r\n\r\n###20/10/01 - 0.2.3\r\n* Added history ordering\r\n* Better time management.\r\n* PGN output for game recording.\r\n* Bugfixes\r\n\r\n###13/10/01 - 0.2.2\r\n* Changed GPL license\r\n* Added quiescent search\r\n* Bugfixes\r\n\r\n###09/10/01 - 0.2.1\r\n* Added internal iterative deepening\r\n* Bugfixes\r\n\r\n###03/10/01 - 0.2.0\r\n* Switched to MTD(f)\r\n* Bugfixes\r\n\r\n###01/10/01 - 0.1.5\r\n* Bit of documentation.\r\n* Fixed the hashtable (maybe)\r\n\r\n###01/10/01 - 0.1.4\r\n* Improved packaging.\r\n* Couple of bugfixes.\r\n\r\n###16/04/01 - 0.1.3\r\n* Switched to Zobrist hashing.\r\n* Switched to negamax\r\n* Added runtime evaluation board loading\r\n* Lots of bugfixes (especially hashtable)\r\n\r\n###14/03/01 - 0.1.2\r\n* Added hashtable.\r\n* Lots of bugfixes.\r\n\r\n###14/02/01 - 0.1.1\r\n* Added first move move ordering.\r\n* Improved FICS automation.\r\n* Better logging and recording\r\n* Lots of bugfixes\r\n\r\n###25/12/00 - 0.1.0\r\n* Initial release\r\n\r\nComments, code, bugreports and patches are welcome.\r\n\r\n  Copyright (C) 2000 Alejandro Dubrovsky\r\n\r\n  Small Potato is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n  the Free Software Foundation; version 2 of the License.\r\n\r\n  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
