Small Potato used to be called unches.  It still plays under that name in FICS.

This is my attempt at a chess engine.  The code is messy and sparsely 
commented.  It is also quite weak at the moment.  This could all change.

To run using xboard as a frontend, use 'xboard -fcp "smallpotato <options>"'
To run it through WinBoard, you will need to add something like the following to
your winboard.ini:
/fcp "smallpotato <theoptions>" /fd "full\path\to\smallpotato\directory"
/scp "smallpotato <theoptions>" /sd "full\path\to\smallpotato\directory"
If you are using some other interface, then you should read its documentation.

The easier method of configuration now is using the configuration file.  "sp.rc" is
first looked for, and if that doesn't exist, "sp.ini" is opened.  You can also
specify a configuration file through the -config commandline switch.  A default
sp.rc is supplied with instructions on what each switch means.

It is also almost fully configurable through the command line.  Run "smallpotato -help" 
to list them all, or read doc/help.txt if you don't see anything when you run it (some
windows versions).  

Most of the control, though, is through commands during the running  of the program 
(eg. To create or modify a book).  Read commands.txt in the doc directory for more 
information on these.

Small Potato uses clig (version 1.9.9 or greater) to take care of the command
line handling.  It can be gotten from: http://wsd.iitb.fhg.de/~kir/clighome/ clig
is no longer needed for compiling the distribution since cmdline.c and cmdline.h
are being included, but is still needed if you are planning to change the command
line options.
