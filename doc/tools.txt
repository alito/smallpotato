A couple of tools that might be handy (located in the tools directory off the main directory):

procvalues.py:  Transform a sort of human readable form of the position-value 
tables to something smallpotato can understand with the -values switch

makebookfrompgn.py:  Feed a pgn file (with possibly thousands of games) to 
smallpotato to add to its book.opn
