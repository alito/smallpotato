List of commands

Small Potato accepts most commands that form part of the IETF protocol version 2.  
For a list of those, you should probably read
<http://www.tim-mann.org/xboard/engine-intf.html>

It also accepts a number of extensions.  When in xboard mode, these need to be 
prefixed with "SP_" to avoid clashes with future IETF protocol modifications 
(eg SP_PERFT instead of PERFT) .  The "SP_" prefix is only required when in xboard mode,
but is always accepted.  The commands are (case is not important):

SANMOVE - utility command to be able to send the move in SAN format.

BENCHMOVEUNMOVE <move> - time how long it takes to perform a move, and an 
unmove  (move should be in e2e4 style of format, as used by USERMOVE)

BENCHMOVEGEN <number> - time <number> of calls to the move generator.

BENCHMOVECYCLE <depth> - time the cycle of moving, generating, unmoving cycle 
to a depth of <depth> ply.

BENCHEVAL <number> - perform <number> times of current evaluation function on 
current board.

PERFT <depth> - same as crafty's perft.

EPDLINE <epdline> - time solving of <epdline> (using current time limits)
For now, only the am and bm ops are recognised.

EPDSUITE <epdsuite> - read each line in epdsuite and perform an SP_EPDLINE on 
it.

EPDMINDEPTH <mindepth> - minimum depth at which an epd can be considered solved.  Checkmates
will return earlier.  To make an epd run till time runs out, just set this to a 
sufficiently high number (eg 50)

MODIFYBOOK <bookfile> - open book file for writing, creating if necessary.  
This switches Small Potato to book editing mode and will remain in that state 
until it exits or the CLOSEBOOK command is sent.  This mode is similar to 
FORCEd mode except that any move sent through USERMOVE will be added to the book.

CLOSEBOOK - stop editing book

EVALUATE - print static evaluation of current board

HELP - nothing tricky there
